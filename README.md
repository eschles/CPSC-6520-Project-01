# CPSC-6520-Project-01
Project 1 for CPSC 6520 -- Chandni Murmu and Alex Schlesener

# Initial Thoughts (2/8)
1. Project Layout:
    - Small simple game --> Pong
    - Generalizable:
            1. EventHandler and the FrameViewer
                - Loop, Controller, Viewer
    - Not generalizable:
            1. Entities (things)
                - Player Character

# Motivation behind the game chosen: 
1. Explain why you chose to build the game that you did and what inspired you.

2. Reasoning behind the structure: Discuss the reasoning behind the structure of your game and why you chose to implement it in the way that you did.

3. Image of classes and functions and connections: Include a diagram or image that shows the relationships between the classes, functions, and variables in your game.

# Future Work:
1. How can you further enhance the game engine elements of the game? Discuss how you can further improve the game engine and add new features to the game.

# Generalization: 
1. Discuss how the game could be generalized to other types of games or applications.
